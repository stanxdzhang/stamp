Problem:

The internet has been decades in our life. Email is still one of the most important communication tools for billions of people in the world. Some key natures are supporting Email to be long-surviving: (1) Email can enable people to communicate with each other as long as they have internet access, it’s essential and easy to use. (2) An Email address is a unique identity on the entire internet, can be independent of any platform. This is different from other IDs on various internet platforms i.e., one’s Facebook ID or his Youtube ID. Because of this, email is widely used to verify a user’s viability on many internet platforms and mobile Apps. (3) Email is suitable to handle huge amounts of messages over a very long time, being archivable and searchable and has been accepted to be legal evidence electronically.

However, the usability of Email is ruined by SPAMs. Everyone’s email box may receive annoying SPAM emails every day, sometimes with malicious content. As one of the earliest Internet entrepreneurs in China, I proactively participated in the antispam campaign led by the Internet Society of China (ISC). Most of the major email service providers in China, including my company, HiChina, participated in the campaign. Now almost every email service provider has equipped with anti-SPAM/Phishing solutions. International anti-SPAM/Phishing organizations have been established. Major email service providers have been working with each other to fight against spammers. Machine learning and Artificial intelligence technologies are adopted to improve efficiency and accuracy. However, anti-SPAM campaigns never won. Today, we see SPAMs or Phishing emails still exist, and sometimes important emails were put into SPAM box by anti-SPAM software.

The above are caused by the following reasons (1) The old standard email transmission protocols (SMTP and ESMTP) have limited anti-SPAM mechanisms;(2) Spammers are also using technologies to avoid SPAMs being identified and filtered; (3) In many cases it’s difficult to determine an email as SPAM or not - i.e., the newsletters from your children’s school, or notifications from your bank, or invitation letters by activity organizers; (4) I believe this is the deepest reason: the cost of sending SPAMs is way too low. Spammers are sending thousands of emails at the cost of a penny.

As a result of today's situation, millions of SPAM emails are transferred over the internet every minute and stored on the servers, wasting the network bandwidth and leading to remarkable and senseless cost to service providers, as well wasting energy and worsening our environment. All email users are suffering. According to statista.org, there were 280 billion emails transmitted every day in 2018, 45.3% of the emails belong to SPAM.

Solution:

I was inspired by traditional physical mail. In our life, households and businesses receive advertising paper mails but not at a huge amount. The direct reason is there is a cost for every mail charged by the post office. Why don’t we design a new email system that includes a fee mechanism? I will describe how excited this system will work in the following paragraph.

I was also inspired by WeChat, the most famous Instant Messaging mobile app originated in China, which is used by more than 1.1 billion users every day. On WeChat, users must become friends or buddies before being able to send messages with each other. Based on this mechanism, there is NO SPAM on WeChat because if you send me a SPAM message, I remove you from my friend(buddy) list, then you can never send me any message again. 

In the new email system, I propose to integrate these mechanisms mentioned above. In my proposal, an email user can accept another email user as a friend or buddy. There will be no cost to send and receive emails between friends. Considering the real world’s needs, the new email system supports emails to be delivered to a user’s email box without requesting the sender to be a friend of the receiving user, but needs to use Stamps. A Stamp is a cost for an email to be delivered from the sender to the receiver’s email box. In this new email system, an email to be delivered from one email user to another email user can be free, if the two users are friends; or be charged a Stamp(or some Stamps) if the two parties are not friends, and the number of Stamps is variable. The number of Stamps to be used by a sender can be adjusted by the receiving user. A user can set up different prices(number of Stamps) for every sender that might send emails to him at any time. If the sender does not pay a sufficient amount of money on the Stamps that is more than the price set by the receiving user, the email will be rejected. With this mechanism, users can decide who's emails they are willing to receive and at what price. If a spammer still wants to send an advertisement email to a user, he needs to pay enough money for the Stamps to get the email to be delivered.

The money spent on buying Stamps will be shared between email service providers, receiving users and the community. A user does not necessarily have to have any Stamp if he is not sending emails to the parties that are not his friends. He can accumulate Stamps if he accepts to receive emails sent from parties that are not his friends. When he has enough Stamps, he can also send emails to the parties who are not his friends by spending the Stamps that he has collected. You can see the Stamps are circulating in the system. Users can also buy Stamps from the markets to satisfy their business or personal needs.

Each user will have a wallet combined with his email account and client software to keep the Stamps. 

To ease the operation of the new email system, a virtual coin/token is proposed to be introduced. The reason not to use fiat money in the system is it will be more costly to manage a very small amount of fiat to be spent on the Stamps. More importantly, the global email system is not operated by one single service provider, it will be operated by multiple service providers worldwide. A decentralized ledger is needed to record how the Stamps are bought, used and shared for each email delivered. The decentralized ledger must be independent of any email operator and should be maintained by the parties in the ecosystem. The parties include email users, email service providers and a decentralized autonomous organization that oversights the operation of the system and makes decisions on key policy changes if needed. The decentralized ledger must be consistent, transparent and verifiable by either the parties abovementioned or auditors or government authorities or agencies.

Technically, to achieve the above goals, a series of milestones need to be achieved:  (1) A robust blockchain is needed. The blockchain must be very fast to match the speed of thousands of emails transferred every second of an email server system. (2)A brand new email transportation system is needed, which includes: (a) Email address verification is a must. This is the basis for building a buddy relationship. Spammers never have ways to fake email addresses, phishing will become impossible. (b) Use of Stamps will be supported, users can set up prices for every sender by themselves. (c) The new protocol shall be compatible with the existing SMTP/ESMTP protocols until the email systems around the world gradually upgrade to the new protocol. (d) New email client software is developed to include a wallet of Stamps.

On governance, a decentralized autonomous organization needs to be formed, a lot of work needs to be done.

Benefits to the parties:

1).     No more SPAM or Phishing. No missed emails or appointments anymore. Email becomes a reliable communication tool again.

2).     Useless internet traffic reduced greatly. Storage space saved. Energy waste and CO2 emission reduced.

3).     Users get rewards if they are willing to receive commercial emails.

4).     Service providers get paid by handling emails. The more emails they handle, the more revenue they earn. They don’t need to rely on advertisements as a single revenue source anymore. Advertising is still doable, and it may become more targeted and effective. 

5).     Because of 4, service providers are incentivized to better protect users' privacy. Email content will be encrypted.


Some technical considerations:
1).     The blockchain mentioned above will only serve the creation of the Stamp, and record the Stamp transaction. The transmission and storage of emails are not on the blockchain.
2).     Email address verification: PKI may be good.
3).     Encryption of content: only do encryption during transmission. Encryption/Decryption is invisible to users.
4).     Others: a lot. Leave this part to technology geeks and talents...

Some marketing thoughts:
(I keep this part private)

Lastly, I am looking for people who are enthusiastic about this mission and want to make it a reality. After reading this article, have you realized this is a great project?
