Proposal of
A New Generation of Email System

2019-10-28 
First Revision


Problem:
The internet has been decades in our life. Email is still one of the most important communication tools for billions of people in the world. Some key natures are supporting Email to be long surviving: (1) Email can enable people to communicate with each other as long as they have internet access, it’s essential and easy to use. (2) An Email address is a unique identity on the entire internet, can be independent of any platform. This is different from other IDs on various internet platforms i.e., one’s Facebook ID or his Youtube ID. Because of this, email is widely used to verify a user’s viability on many internet platforms and mobile Apps. (3) Email is suitable to handle huge amounts of messages over a very long time, being archivable and searchable. 

However, the beauty of Email is ruined by SPAMs. Everyone’s email box may receive a certain number of SPAM emails every day. Sometimes you see annoying SPAMs or Phishing emails in your inbox, and sometimes important emails were put into SPAM box by your anti-SPAM software. To prevent SPAM, companies have been working on Anti-SPAM/Phishing technologies for decades. Almost every email service provider has equipped with anti-SPAM/Phishing solutions. International anti-SPAM/Phishing organizations have been established. Major email service providers have been working with each other to fight against spammers. Machine learning and Artificial intelligence technologies are adopted to improve the efficiency and accuracy. However, anti-SPAM campaigns never won. This is because (1) Spammers are using technologies as well to avoid SPAMs being identified and filtered; (2) In many cases it’s difficult to determine an email as SPAM or not - i.e., the newsletters from your children’s school, or notifications from your bank, or invitation letters by activity organizers.

The fundamental reasons behind the rampant SPAMs are (1) The standard email transmission protocols (SMTP and ESMTP) have limited anti-SPAM mechanisms because they were designed during the early stage of internet development. (2) the cost of sending SPAMs are way too low. Spammers are sending thousands of emails at the cost of a penny. As a result, millions of SPAM emails are transferred over the internet every minute and stored on the servers, wasting the network bandwidth and leading to remarkable and senseless cost to service providers, as well wasting energy and worsening our environment. All email users are suffering.

Solution:
I was inspired by traditional physical mail. In our life, households and businesses receive advertising mails but not at a huge amount. The direct reason is there is a cost for every mail charged by the post office. Why don’t we design a new email system that includes a fee mechanism? I will describe how excited this system will work in the following paragraph.

I was also inspired by WeChat, the most famous Instant Messaging mobile app originated in China, which is used by more than 1.1 billion users every day. On WeChat, users must become friends or buddies before being able to send messages with each other. Based on this mechanism, there is NO SPAM on WeChat because if you send me a SPAM message, I remove you from my friend list, then you can never send me any message again. 

In the new email system, I propose to integrate these mechanisms mentioned above. In my proposal, an email user can accept another email user as a friend or buddy. There will be no cost to send and receive emails between friends. Considering the real world needs, the new email system supports emails to be delivered to a user’s email box without requesting the sender to be a friend of the receiving user, but need to use Stamps. A Stamp is the cost for an email to be delivered from the sender to the receiver’s email box. In this new email system, an email to be delivered from one email user to another email user can be free, if the two users are friends; or be charged a Stamp if the two parties are not friends, and the price of a Stamp is variable. The price of the Stamps can be adjusted by the receiving user. A user can set up different prices for every sender that might send email to him at any time. If the sender does not pay a sufficient amount of money on the Stamp that is more than the price set by the receiving user, the email will be rejected. With this mechanism, users can decide what email they are willing to receive and at what price. If a spammer still wants to send an advertisement email to a user, he needs to pay enough money on the Stamp to get the email to be delivered.

The cost spent on buying Stamps will be shared between email service providers, receiving users and the community. A user does not necessarily have to have any Stamp if he is not sending emails to the parties that are not his friends. He can accumulate Stamps if he accepts to receive emails sent from parties that are not his friends. When he has enough Stamps, he can also send emails to the parties who are not his friends by spending the Stamps. You can see the Stamps are circulating in the system. Users can also buy Stamps from the markets to satisfy their business or personal needs.

Each user will have a wallet combined with his email account and client software to keep the Stamps. 

To ease the operation of the new email system, a virtual coin/token is proposed to be introduced. The reason not to use fiat money in the system is it will be more costly to manage very small amount of fiat to be spent on the Stamps. More importantly, global email system is not operated by one single service provider, it will be operated by multiple services providers worldwide. A decentralized ledger is needed to record how the Stamps are bought, used and shared for each email delivered. The decentralized ledger must be independent to any email operator and should be maintained by the parties in the ecosystem. The parties include email users, email service providers and a decentralized autonomous organization that oversights the operation of the system and makes decisions on key policy changes if needed. The decentralized ledger must be consistent, transparent and verifiable by either the parties abovementioned or auditors or government authorities or agencies.

To achieve the above goals, a robust blockchain is needed. The blockchain must be very fast to match the speed of thousands or millions of emails transferred every second on the internet. The standard SMTP/ESMTP protocols needs to be redesigned. The following requirements are needed: (1) Email address verification is a must. Spammers never have a way to fake email addresses to cheat. (2) Use of Stamps will be supported, users can setup Stamp price by themselves. (3) New protocol shall be compatible with the existing SMTP/ESMTP protocols until the email systems around the world gradually upgrade to the new protocol. (4) New email client software be developed to include a wallet of Stamps.


Benefits to the parties:
1.	No more SPAM or Phishing. No missed emails or appointments anymore. Email become a reliable communication tool again.
2.	Useless internet traffic reduced greatly. Storage space saved. Energy waste and CO2 emission reduced.
3.	Users get more reward if they are willing to receive more commercial emails.
4.	Service provider get paid by handling emails. The more emails they handle, the most revenue they earn. They don’t need to rely on advertisements as single revenue source anymore. Advertising is still doable, and it may become more targeted and effective.
